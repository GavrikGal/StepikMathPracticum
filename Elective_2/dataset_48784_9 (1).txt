The second part of the ride begins with a butterfly figure-eight element consisting of sharp twists and turns.
"Anaconda" is a song by Trinidadian-born American rapper Nicki Minaj, from her third studio album, The Pinkprint (2014).
Upon release "Anaconda" was met with mixed to positive reviews from music critics, with some of them praising the song's production and Minaj's return to her hip-hop roots.
To further promote the song, Minaj performed it live at the 2014 MTV Video Music Awards and also performed it at Fashion Rocks and the iHeartRadio Music Festival. 
Carolyn Menyes from Music Times gave the song a positive review, calling it a bit "raunchy" though this was "expected" and saying "Anaconda" continues Minaj's promise to move away from her poppier singles such as "Super Bass" and "Starships", and go back to her hardcore rap roots.
